       <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Prophetic Seerah: Intro Part 1</h2>

       <h3>What is Seerah?</h3>

       <p>Seerah means a path where somebody walks. A direction that somebody takes. Seerah means a pathway or a sidewalk. Seerah refers to a persons life. Allah mentions in Surah Taha telling Musa to grab the snake and it will turn back to its original seerat. So seerah is the original form or shape of something. The first way or shape something is. Seerah is a how a person looks, walks, talks, and lives. Seerah is a literary term and it refers to a biography of someone. We will be discussing the Prophetic Biography.</p>

       <h3>What is the Prophetic Biography?</h3>

       <p>The Prophetic biography is everything which has come to us from all of the occurences of the Prophet. The life and times of the prophet. It comes from his practice and his days. Every single day of the prophet is from his seerah. The physical descriptions and mannerisms are a part of his seerah. The family life and military expeditions are also a part of his seerah.</p>

       <h3>Why Study Seerah?</h3>

       <p>The study of the seerah goes hand in hand with the study of the Quran. Seerah is a combination of facts and a flowing narrative. When listening or reading the seerah we extract lessons that we can relate to and act upon what we have learned. The purpose of the seerah is to extract benefit for our lives. Allah tells us in the Quran that there is no doubt in the life of the prophet there is consistently an excellent example exclusively for you. There is no other role model better than the prophet. The prophet will only be the best role model for you if you completely immerse yourself in the life of the prophet. We must try to walk in the shoes of the prophet. We must live our lives the way the prophet lived. A study of the seerah in depth will give us an understanding in the life of the prophet.</p>

       <p>Hadith is very technical. It is a collection of dry facts. We must humanize the prophet so that we can relate to him. When we can relate to the prophet is when we are able to follow his example. It is highly important to have great respect and reverance to the prophet. At the same time the prophet should not be so distant to us that we cannot relate to him. There are two terms used in different ways and it is hadith and sunnah. Hadiths are quotations from the life of the prophet. Scholars derive rulings from the hadith. Everyone should know the hadith along with the Quran, sunnah, and seerah. A healthy muslim is one who has a good balance in every field of Islam such as Quran, Hadith, Sunnah, Fiqh, and Seerah. A preference is given to studying seerah more. Sunnah is another terminology. Sunnah includes everything in the life of the prophet. Sunnah depends on the context in which you use it. Sunnah could mean a tradition, obligatory deeds, optional deeds, and life of the prophet.</p>

       <p>We can extract lessons from the seerah. Studying the seerah makes the life of the prophet revelant for us to follow his example. This relates to how we study the seerah and what we take from it. When we study the life of the prophet it is a practical guide to how to live your life. The life of the prophet consists of a makkan period and madani period. The makkan period of prophethood was 13 years long. The madani period of prophethood was 10 years long. The makkan period was more covert and the madani period was wide open. We can receive emotional consolation from studying the seerah of the prophet. By studying the seerah we get a full rounded appreciation of the life of the prophet. There is 23 years of prophethood and 40 years before prophethood. By studying the life of the prophet before the prophethood it gives us an insight on how life in makkah was like.</p>

       <p>By studying the seerah we come to find the life of the prophet and hadiths to be authenthic. It becomes easier for us to love and follow the prophet. The system put in place to preserve the seerah is the same system to preserve the Quran and Hadith. The same narrators of Hadith are the same narrators of the Quran, Seerah, and the arabic language. Allah told us in the Quran that He has preserved the Quran. Allah also tells us in the Quran to follow the prophet. So Allah has preserved the hadiths as well. Not finding the seerah and hadiths authentic is a spirtual issue. We cannot follow the prophet until we love him and we cannot love the prophet until we know him. When you learn about the prophet then you cannot help but to love him. Then it becomes easier to follow the prophet.</p>
