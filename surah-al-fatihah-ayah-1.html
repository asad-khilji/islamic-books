       <h2 style="text-align: center;">Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 1</h2>

       <h3>Introduction</h3>

       <p>Surah Al Fatihah begins with Alhamdulillah. It is because of the Hadith Qudsi where Allah begins with Alhamdulillah instead of Bismillah. Within that Hadith Qudsi Allah is saying that I have divided the prayer between Me and My slave. Allah responds to us everytime we recite the Fatihah. It is a direct conversation we have with Allah in the salah. Allah calls Al Fatihah the prayer so the essence of the prayer is the fatihah. This surah was revealed in Makkah.</p>

       <h3>Praise and Thanks</h3>

        <p>Hamd means Praise and Thanks. There is a difference between praise and thanks. Praise and Thanks are two different ideas. We can praise without thanking and we can thank without praising. You can praise a mountain but you do not thank the mountain. You can praise a nice car, but you do not thank the car. Ibrahim thanks his father for raising him but does not praise his worship of the idols. Musa thanked the pharoah for raising him, but he does not praise him as a god. When we say Alhamdulillah we need two attitudes in mind praise and thanks. We cannot complain after saying Alhamdulillah. We must find a genuine reason to praise and thank Allah. Our deen begins with a statement of optimism. It is a complete change in thought and attitude. Gratitude is limited to a reaction, but the Hamd of Allah is not limited to a reaction.</p>

        <h3>Nouns and Verbs</h3>

        <p>There is a difference between nouns and verbs. Nouns are timeless and permanent. Verbs are temporary and either stuck in the past, present, or future tense. A verb requires someone or something to do the action. A noun does not need anyone or anything to do an action. Nouns are independent and verbs are dependent on someone or something. Praise and thanks is a noun. So the praise and thanks to Allah is timeless and independent. Allah does not need anyone or anything to praise or thank Him.</p>

        <h3>The Two Kinds of Sentences</h3>

        <p>There are two kinds of sentences. Informational sentences and emotional sentences. Informational sentences communicate information and it could be right or wrong. Emotional sentences communicate emotion and there is not right or wrong. Praise and thanks is for Allah is a informational and emotional sentence. If Allah said Innal Alhamdulillah it would informational sentence only and not emotional.</p>

        <h3>Reversing the Order</h3>

        <p>Alhamdulliah means praise and thanks is for Allah. Lillahi Al hamd means praise and thanks is only for Allah. Praise and thanks is only for Allah is used when arguing with people. Surah Al Fatihah is a statement from the heart and we already know about Allah. Surah Al Fatihah is not arguing with anyone. Surah Al Jathiya uses Lillahi hil Hamd because it is arguing with the polytheists that praise and thanks is only for Allah.</p>

        <h3>The Name of Allah</h3>

        <p>By using the name of Allah you are calling on all the names and attributes of Allah. Surah Al Fatihah is Allah introducing himself to us. Names are very important in an introduction. The Name of Allah is the proper name of Allah. Also by using the name of Allah it clears any confusion for hamd being for anyone or anything else.</p>

        <h3>The Ultimate Praise and Thanks</h3>

        <p>Praise and thanks could be for other than Allah, but ultimately priase and thanks goes back to Allah. The Ultimate, Genuine, Sincere, and Timeless Priase and Thanks is for Allah who is independent from His creation.</p>

        <h3>Rabb</h3>

        <p>Rabb consists of four names and attributes malik, sayyed, murrabi, qayyim, and munnim. Malik means owner and master. Sayyed is someone who is in control and in charge. Murrabi is someone who makes sure something grows and improves it constantly. Qayyim is someone who takes care of something constantly. Sayyed is someone who makes sure something remains in tact. Munnim is someone who is the giver of gifts. Everything Allah gives us is a gift. When we receive a gift we cannot complain.</p>

        <h3>Alameen</h3>

        <p>Alameen means nations and people. Someone who needs a warning. Nations and people of every generation, every culture, in every time and place.</p>
