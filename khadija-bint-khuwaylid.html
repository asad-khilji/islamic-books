        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Khadija Bint Khuwaylid</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>The mothers of the believers are the wives of the prophet. By achieving this level of being with the prophet on a daily basis and being raised on the day of judgment with him shows how much Allah loves them and has favored them. The wives of the prophet were truly amazing people and they are on a whole different level. They are different from other women. They struggled throughout their lives before and after marrying the prophet. It is important we love and honor the wives of the prophet just like our birth mothers. Any time we study any aspect of the seerah we love the prophet even more. We get to see the prophet how he was in his home with his family. The houses of the mothers of the believers were very small, so they did not live a very glamorous lifestyle. By studying the lives of our mothers it gives us guidance in our marriages. Pure men are for pure women. So if you want a wife like Khadija, you must be a man like the prophet and vice versa. When studying the lives of the mothers of the believers we must extract lessons for our benefit and guidance. We read these stories with a lens of self-development and improving ourselves.</p>

        <h3>Her Status</h3>

        <p>Khadija Bint Khuwaylid is the best of the mothers of the believers. We learn a lot from our mother. She only until the persecution of Makkah, but did not see salah or Hajj. Seerah collection was not a priority rather surviving was a priority in that time. The sources we have on Khadija is very little. The Prophet said the greatest women was Maryam Bint Imran in her time and Khadija Bint Khuwaylid in her time. The Prophet also said that four women perfected their faith Maryam Bint Imran, Asiya the wife of Pharoah, Khadija Bint Khuwaylid, and Fatima Bint Muhammad. Khadija is one half of the 4 women who protected their faith.</p>

One of Khadija's cousin Hakeem was the only child born in the kaaba. Hakeem details much of the life of Khadija. Khuwaylid's son is Awwam whose son is Zubair. Awwam marries Safiyah bint Abdul Mutalib. Safiyah is the aunt of the Prophet more like a sister. Safiyah has a servant named Salma who breastfeeds the children of Khadija from her previous marriages.</p>

Khadija and Abu bakr both of them never worshipped an idol. Khadija was called At Tahir or the Pure One. Khadija was called the pure one because she was very honest and modest. Her sharpness was combined with her innocence. Waraqa was expected to marry Khadija, but he was in the path to be a monk and he did not want to get married.</p>

        <h3>Her First Marriage</h3>

        <p>Khadija's first husband was Abu Khala bin Zurrara At Tameem. She had two sons from him, Khala and Hind. Hind is a very famous companion.

Khadija is widowed twice with 4 kids at the age of 25. Khadija went a long time without getting married. Khadija inherited from very wealthy men and her parents were wealthy as well. Khadija had one of the biggest caravan in the society. She would turn down all other proposals. The women of Makkah would gather for a festival and their was a man who announced O women of Makkah the porphet is coming with name of Ahmad. Those who can marry him should marry him.

The Prophet asked Abu Talib to send him out to trade. The Prophet was a sheperd at a yound age then a merchant as he grew older. The Prophet was a sheperd for Khadija's sister Khala. Then he works for Khadija as a merchant after the age of 18. Before working for Khadija the prophet did not travel outside Makkah. Khadija was desperate for someone honest. She was referred to the prophet so she hires him. Khadija meets the prophet and they discuss the terms. Khadija sends the prophet with her goods and masara who accompanied the prophet was amazed. The prophet was very honest, successful, and a cloud followed him everywhere. Also the tree extended its branches to shade the Prophet when he rested under it. A monk who was there said no noe rests under the tree except a prophet. The tree is still alive today in the middle of Jordan with nothing else there. Masara realizes that he does not worship idols. Khadija doubles the profit for the the prophet, the prophet doubled her profit.</p>

        <p>Khadija hears about the prophet from Masara. Then she is amazed. Khadija talks about the prophet to Nafisa her best friend. Nafisa suggests to Khadija to marry the prophet. Khadija then asks Nafisa to ask the prophet if he is interested in marriage. The prophet was also busy making money. Nafisa says why are you not marry. The Prophet says I am very busy. Nafisa says would you want to marry Khadija. The Prophet said would she be interested in me. Nafisa says I am not sure let me ask her. Nafisa tells Khadija that the prophet is interested. Nafisa tells the prophet that Khadija is interested. The prophet proposes to Khadija and tells Abu Talib involved. Khadija then sees a dream of the sun landing in her lap. Khadija goes to Waraqa about the dream and he says that you will marry that awaited prophet. Khadija's uncle or Waraqa conducts their marriage. The mahr is 500 dirhams.
